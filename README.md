# CyanTrigger
CyanTrigger is a new compiler for Udon with focus on in-scene editing. The interface resembles the old SDK2 VRC Trigger interface, but has more functionality. CyanTrigger has full access to all of Udon and can work with UdonGraph and UdonSharp. CyanTrigger can be [downloaded from Booth.pm](https://cyanlaser.booth.pm/items/3194594).

## Features
- Easy interface for adding quick logic in your scene
- Customizable with favorite lists and Custom Actions
- Compatible with both UdonGraph and UdonSharp
