# CyanTrigger
CyanTrigger is a new compiler for Udon with focus on in-scene editing. The interface resembles the old SDK2 VRC Trigger interface, but has more functionality. CyanTriggers is not intended to replace UdonGraph or UdonSharp, but work alongside those tools. Currently only available through [**CyanLaser's Patreon**](http://patreon.com/CyanLaser).

## Features
- Easy interface for adding quick logic in your scene
- Customizable with favorite lists and Custom Actions
- Compatible with both UdonGraph and UdonSharp
